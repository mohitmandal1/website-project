        <p>OnePlus Nord 2 review: a bonafide mid-range champ
            OnePlus' latest Nord 2 has been announced starting at Rs 27,999. Here is our full review of the device.</p>
            <center><img src="img2.webp"> </center>

        <p>OnePlus has employed the Dimensity 1200 5G flagship chipset to be the harbinger of processing prowess. Realme has done the same with the X7 Max (review) while iQOO and Xiaomi are employing the services of Qualcomm and its Snapdragon 870 chipset in this segment. The Nord 2 has some strong competition but this time around OnePlus has put in a greater emphasis on the phone’s image taking capabilities as well to tilt the odds in its favour. Launched at a starting price of Rs 27,999, here is a full review of the OnePlus Nord 2 to see if it is worthy of your consideration.</p>
        <center><img src="img3.jpg"></center>
        <p>Moving on to the display, OnePlus has implemented the same 90Hz Super AMOLED display it has been using on previous 
            Nord phones. It has an FHD+ (1,080 x 2,400) resolution and a 20:9 aspect ratio along with a single punch-hole dis
            play, unlike the dual cutout present on the original Nord. I have generally been a fan of the viewing 
            experience OnePlus provides and the Nord 2 makes use of several key new elements to amplify this. The AI 
            resolution boost can upscale the resolution on lower-quality videos while the AI colour boost heightens the
             colours. OnePlus has said that the former is compatible with major apps like YouTube and Instagram. I did tes
             t it out on a couple of videos with favourable results.
            
            <br> <br>
            </p>
             <p>The usual screen colour temperatures and profile options are present to fine-tune the display to your liking. 
                 Support for HDR10 and WideVine L1 allows the Nord 2 to leverage HD quality videos on OTT platforms for a more 
                 enjoyable experience. While the AMOLED panel works as advertised in its ability to provide excellent viewing 
                 angles and deep blacks, I do have some complaints with the slightly less than acceptable brightness levels.
                  Even so, the 90Hz refresh rate works like a charm with negligible stuttering and making the whole interface
                   silky smooth. While 120Hz has become pretty much a norm these days, users coming from a 60Hz display should
                    be more than satisfied with the Nord 2s 90Hz screen capabilities. </p>
                   <center><img src="img4.webp"></center> 

                   <p>Daylight shooting is one of the Nord 2s
                       
                    greatest strengths and it shows how good OnePlus colour 
                    science has become over the years. With saturation kept at a minimum, 
                    the Nord 2 clicks realistic shots with a pronounced white balance that combines with
                     excellent dynamic range capabilities. The detailing is sharp and spread out over the entire 
                     frame, unlike a few other OEMs which keep the focus centred. While regular photos are pixel-binned 
                     you do have the option to click detailed 50MP shots to further your ability to zoom into a shot. It comes 
                     at the expense of occupying significantly more space on your phone though.</p>
                     <center><img src="img5.webp"></center>
                     <p>In terms of storage options, the Rs 27,999 starting price will give you 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of 
                         non-expandable UFS 3.1 internal storage, which I believe to be a fair deal. You can go all the way up to
                          12GB + 256GB, but I think that 8GB RAM should be more than sufficient. There are other aspects of the
                           device which are compelling as well. For instance, the in-display fingerprint sensor never misses a 
                           beat and offers lightning-fast authentication. OnePlus has also included stereo speakers which sound
                            good, but arent really as loud and clear as the one on the OnePlus 9. An underrated but truly
                            appreciable feature is the amazing haptic feedback on the Nord 2 which lends a more premium touch
                            while interacting with the device. Of course, the phone is part of the tidal wave of devices that
                            support 5G although the current 4G capacity is excellent enough on Jios Noida network. The
                            microphone and earpiece on the device work as expected.</p>

                            <p>Lets also talk about software for a moment as the OnePlus Nord 2 is the first phone which has been
                                 launched after OnePlus announcement of deeper integration with OPPOs ColorOS. At the moment Nord 2
                                  runs the OxygenOS 11.3 UI which has some elements of the ColorOS interface, specifically in the
                                   camera app. Most of the UI elements are more-or-less the same as previous OxygenOS versions and I
                                    sincerely hope OnePlus maintains it for all future updates. The minimalistic approach and theme 
                                    customisability of OxygenOS is always appreciated as is the lack of bloatware. OnePlus is extremely
                                     fast in providing software updates, so expect Android 12 to drop on the Nord 2 real soon. 
                                     It remains to be seen, however, the extent to which ColorOS is going to be integrated on OnePlus 
                                     devices going forward.

                                <center><img src="img6.webp"</center>
                                <p>In terms of battery life, the 4,500mAh cell on the OnePlus Nord 2 suffices most 
                                    of my daily needs from a smartphone with about 20-25 percent left at the end of the day.
                                     OnePlus also has some neat battery-saving tricks tucked away in the settings menu which
                                      further extend the usage. I got about 2-3 hours of BGMI on maximum settings which drained
                                       the battery by about 60 percent. Even so, the Warp Charge 65T technology juices up the
                                        device from 0 to 100 in less than 30 minutes. On PC Mark’s Battery 3.0 test the Nord 2
                                         scored 13 hours 38 minutes, which is par for the course for a phone with a 4,500mAh
                                          battery.</p>
